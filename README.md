# AI-Based-Casting-Defect-Detection

This repository contains the code, models, and deployment setup used for my Master's thesis: **"Data Analytics and Machine Learning in Industry 4.0: Leveraging cloud based analytics and AI to improve industrial processes"**

## 📌 Overview  
The objective of this work is to develop an intelligent quality control system to detect casting defects in submersible pump impellers using deep learning models. This study compares the performance of the following architectures for **binary classification** of casting defects:

- **MobileNetV2**  
- **ResNet50**  
- **Xception**  
- **EfficientNet**

Comprehensive evaluation was conducted using metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score** to identify the optimal model for industrial deployment.

## 🌐 Web Interface  
The best-performing model was deployed using a **Streamlit-based web interface** for real-time defect prediction and quality assessment.

## 🛠️ Features

- Preprocessed grayscale dataset of 7,348 impeller images  
- Modular deep learning training pipeline  
- Performance visualization and metrics comparison  
- Streamlit web application for live defect prediction  
- Lightweight deployment without containerization
